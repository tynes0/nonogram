Nonogram game on console


You can adjust the TABLE_SIZE macro according to your needs before playing the game. 
If the size is larger than 9 it will look ugly but it still works fine.

While playing, you can switch between indices with w - a - s - d keys. 
You can mark or uncheck the current index with the space bar. 
When you think you're done, you can press enter to see if you've won. 
If you want to play again later, you can start playing again with the p key.
When you want to exit the game anywhere, you can press the esc key.
